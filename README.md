What's next:
- Singletons can be used in a few different places.
- On The Rocket Details Fragment, add Coordinator with scrolling for collapsing the image.
- Improve some layouts, all of them can be better, but specially some of them in landscape. As well graph is kind of simple and it clips text sometimes.
- Add more videos with better explanations (sleep better next time...)
- Replace Dagger by another Kotlin friendly DI tool
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Image transitions
